# seismic-tomography-models

In this database, I collected several whole mantle tomography results, and
converted them into nc files. Each nc files contain 4 values: depth,
longitude, latitude and speed (in km/s). The speed could be either S or P,
indicated in the file names.

Most of the model are downloaded from IRIS SPUD Service:
http://ds.iris.edu/spud/earthmodel
Others are downloaded from links within each paper/author's website and etc.

Here are details about data source and convertion to the nc files:
